import seaborn as sns #Unsure if we need to import matplotlib as well?
import client.dataAnalysis as dataAnalysis




# This file will be for seaborn implementation. We will create different plots to create visualizations based on the data that dataAnalysis.py generates.
# Plan: import the 2 dataframe object variables to compare from the dataAnalysis.py file (from file.py import variableName), and create two pie charts
# to compare genre listening habits by city/state/country.



# Graph types to consider: pie chart, bar graph, or box plot? Pie chart seems most effective.
